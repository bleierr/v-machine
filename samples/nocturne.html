               <p>Saint Eloi, one of the most popular Saints of the Middle Ages,
                                              founded a monastery near the present village of Mont St. Eloi, five miles
                                              northwest of the city of Arras in northern France. The ruins of the monastery
                                              remain, and in 1917-18 were close to the Western Front. There is also a British
                                              Military Cemetery nearby.

               <p>Eloi may also be a reference to the words of Christ on the
                                              cross: 'Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? . . . My God, my God, why hast thou
                                              forsaken me?' (Mark 15:34-5).
